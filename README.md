# CV-Repo
Here I highlight different algorithms I have implemented in both python and C++. This is repo is linked to in my CV. All projects are in different folders.

## Codes
### C++:

### Schroedinger:
See README file in folder for more information. This was a collaboration between me and two other students. They created the potential function, the animation plotting in python and some lines inbetween. Includes mostly c++ code but also python code for plotting.

### Python:

### ODE_with_scipy
Solving coupled Hamiltons equations with scipy_solve_ivp function with plots.

#### Written in Norwegian:
### Soundwave:
This is originally a jupyter notebook on simulating soundwaves by solving the wave equation in two dimensions. The project was intended to look at how sound spread in a room and includes animations of the solution in 2d and 3d plots. The whole project was written in Python and the text added in markdown.

### Charged particles:
Originally a jupyter notebook on simulating charged particles interacting with different electrical fields. A simple Forward-Euler algorithm. Created with another student who did the theoretical aspect as I did all the coding.
