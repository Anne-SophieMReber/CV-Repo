# CV-Repo
Here I highlight different algorithms I have implemented in both python and C++. This is repo is linked to in my CV. All different projects are in different folders.

## Codes
### Schroedinger:
See README file in folder for more information. This was a collaboration between me and two other students. They created the potential function, the animation plotting in python and some lines inbetween. Includes mostly c++ code but also python code for plotting.


### Soundwave:
This is originally a jupyter notebook on simulating soundwaves by solving the wave equation in two dimensions. The project was intended to look at how sound spread in a room. The whole project was written in Python and the text added in markdown.
